//Q1
let Pi = 3.14159

//Q2 & 3
let x: Int = 50
let y: Int = 100
let average = Double((x+y)/2)
/*:
 10/3 will return an integer because 10 and 3 are both integers. However, 10.0/3.0 will return a double since both 10.0 and 3.0 are double. In short, they are different type of variables.
 */

//Q4
var flag: Bool = true
var inputString: String = "Hello world."
let bitsInBite: Int = 8
let averageScore: Double = 86.8

//Q5
var salary = 22000
salary += 28000

//Q6
/*:
 Equality operator is ==
 */

//Q7
let i = 10
let j = 3
let remain = 10%3

//Q8
/*:
 Let is a constant, which you can't manipulate the value after initializing it. Var is a variable, which the value can be modified later on.
 */

//Q9
/*:
 In terms of naming conventions, developers should declare the name as clear as possible for either other team members or future-self to understand our thinking process at certain time. For function, specifically, we should use noun as the name when the function's intention is to return to a type. Similarly, use verb when it's executing some actions such as increasing someone's salary. In terms of rules for writing out the code, it all comes down to personal style. There's no rule for spacing, but you have to be consistent throughout or have to reach a consensus when working in a group.
 */

//Q10
/*:
 Type inference is where Swift guess the type of the variable or constant according to the value you initially assign to.
 */

//Q11
/*:
 The data type of phoneNumber is inconsistent. It was first being assigned as Int but then assigned as String.
